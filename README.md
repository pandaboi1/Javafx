# Tetris Project

## Description
This project was originally made for a Java course but was further improved to make it more stable and eventually would like to upload the project on to the Google play store. 

## Overview
Tetris was created with Javafx and will have users play with a goal of reaching a high score. Only top scores will be stored but potentially there will be a leaderboard that allows users to input their name and compete with each other. There will be an option to key bind your controls if you are playing with a keyboard. Further adjustment will be made to make the game more stable.
